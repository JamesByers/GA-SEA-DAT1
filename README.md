**Homework:**
* Complete GA's friendly [command line tutorial](http://generalassembly.github.io/prework/command-line/#/) using Terminal (Linux/Mac) or Git Bash (Windows).
* Read through this [command line reference](code/02_command_line_basics.md), and complete the pre-class exercise at the bottom. (There's nothing you need to submit once you're done.)
* Watch videos 1 through 8 (21 minutes) of [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5IBLMp7LtN8Nc3Efd4hJq0kD), or read sections 1.1 through 2.2 of [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).
* If your laptop has any setup issues, please work with us to resolve them by Thursday. If your laptop has not yet been checked, you should come early on Thursday, or just walk through the [setup checklist](other/setup_checklist.md) yourself (and let us know you have done so).

**Resources:**
* For a useful look at the different types of data scientists, read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) (32 pages).
* For some thoughts on what it's like to be a data scientist, read these short posts from [Win-Vector](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2012/09/on-being-a-data-scientist/) and [Datascope Analytics](http://datascopeanalytics.com/what-we-think/2014/07/31/six-qualities-of-a-great-data-scientist).
* Quora has a [data science topic FAQ](https://www.quora.com/Data-Science) with lots of interesting Q&A.

-----

### Class 2: Command Line and Version Control

**By the end of this lesson you will be able to:**
* clone a Githib repository to your laptop
* synch your local files with your GitHub repository using git add, commit, push and pull
* use more advanced command line commands such as Grep and |

**Topics/Highlights**
* Slack tour
* Review the command line pre-class exercise ([code](code/02_command_line_basics.md))
* Git and GitHub ([slides](slides/02_git_github.pdf))
* Intermediate command line

**Homework:**
* Complete the [command line homework assignment](homework/02_command_line_chipotle.md) with the Chipotle data.
* Review the code from a [beginner](code/00_python_beginner_workshop.py) and an [intermediate](code/00_python_intermediate_workshop.py) Python workshop. If you don't feel comfortable with any of the content (excluding the "requests" and "APIs" sections), you should spend some time this weekend practicing Python:
    * [Introduction to Python](http://introtopython.org/) does a great job explaining Python essentials and includes tons of example code.
    * If you like learning from a book, [Python for Informatics](http://www.pythonlearn.com/html-270/) has useful chapters on strings, lists, and dictionaries.
    * If you prefer interactive exercises, try these lessons from [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python): "Python Lists and Dictionaries" and "A Day at the Supermarket".
    * If you have more time, try missions 2 and 3 from [DataQuest's Learning Python](https://www.dataquest.io/course/learning-python) course.
    * If you've already mastered these topics and want more of a challenge, try solving [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) number 1 (decoding a message) and send me your code in Slack.
* To give you a framework for thinking about your project, watch [What is machine learning, and how does it work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elojMnjn4kk) (10 minutes). (This is the [IPython notebook](other/scikit-learn_videos/01_machine_learning_intro.ipynb) shown in the video.) Alternatively, read [A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/), which focuses on a specific machine learning model called decision trees.
* **Optional:** Browse through some more [example student projects](/project/project_examples/README.md), which may help to inspire your own project!

**Git and Markdown Resources:**
* [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is an excellent book for learning Git. Read the first two chapters to gain a deeper understanding of version control and basic commands.
* If you want to practice a lot of Git (and learn many more commands), [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) looks promising.
* If you want to understand how to contribute on GitHub, you first have to understand [forks and pull requests](http://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-forks-in-github-and-git/).
* [GitRef](http://gitref.org/) is my favorite reference guide for Git commands, and [Git quick reference for beginners](http://www.dataschool.io/git-quick-reference-for-beginners/) is a shorter guide with commands grouped by workflow.
* [Cracking the Code to GitHub's Growth](https://growthhackers.com/growth-studies/github) explains why GitHub is so popular among developers.
* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) provides a thorough set of Markdown examples with concise explanations. GitHub's [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is a simpler and more attractive guide, but is less comprehensive.

**Command Line Resources:**
* If you want to go much deeper into the command line, [Data Science at the Command Line](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032823.do) is a great book. The [companion website](http://datascienceatthecommandline.com/) provides installation instructions for a "data science toolbox" (a virtual machine with many more command line tools), as well as a long reference guide to popular command line tools.
* If you want to do more at the command line with CSV files, try out [csvkit](http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/), which can be installed via `pip`.

-----

### Class 3: Data Reading and Preparing

**By the end of this lesson you will be able to:**
 * State use case where you would chose a python dictionary over a list and one case where you would choose a list over a dictionary

 * Use Python to convert the data into a nested list (list of lists)

**Topics/Highlights**
* Review command line homework ([solution](homework/02_command_line_chipotle.md))
* Git and GitHub assorted tips ([slides](slides/02_git_github.pdf))
* Python:
    * Spyder interface
    * Looping exercise
    * File reading with airline safety data, code-along  ([article](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-travelers-avoid-flying-airlines-that-have-had-crashes-in-the-past/), [data](data/airlines.csv), [code](code/03_file_reading.py))
    * Data preparation exercise
    * Walkthrough of Python Chipotle homework assignment ([article](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/02/17/upshot/what-do-people-actually-order-at-chipotle.html), [data](data/chipotle.tsv), [code](homework/03_python_homework_chipotle.py))

**Homework:**
* Complete the [Python homework assignment](homework/03_python_homework_chipotle.py) with the Chipotle data, add a commented Python script to your GitHub repo, and submit a link using the homework submission form. *You have until Tuesday (11/10) to complete this assignment.* (**Note:** Pandas, which is covered in class 4, should not be used for this assignment.)

**Resources:**
* [Want to understand Python's comprehensions? Think in Excel or SQL](http://blog.lerner.co.il/want-to-understand-pythons-comprehensions-think-like-an-accountant/) may be helpful if you are still confused by list comprehensions.
* [My code isn't working](http://www.tecoed.co.uk/uploads/1/4/2/4/14249012/624506_orig.png) is a great flowchart explaining how to debug Python errors.
* [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is Python's "classic" style guide, and is worth a read if you want to write readable code that is consistent with the rest of the Python community.
* If you want to understand Python at a deeper level, Ned Batchelder's [Loop Like A Native](http://nedbatchelder.com/text/iter.html) and [Python Names and Values](http://nedbatchelder.com/text/names1.html) are excellent presentations.

Add a commented Python script to your GitHub repo, and submit a link using the homework submission form. (**Note:** Pandas, which is covered in class 4, should not be used for this assignment.)
* Read [How Software in Half of NYC Cabs Generates $5.2 Million a Year in Extra Tips](http://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/107245431809/how-software-in-half-of-nyc-cabs-generates-5-2) for an excellent example of exploratory data analysis.
* Read [Anscombe's Quartet, and Why Summary Statistics Don't Tell the Whole Story](http://data.heapanalytics.com/anscombes-quartet-and-why-summary-statistics-dont-tell-the-whole-story/) for a classic example of why visualization is useful.

**Resources:**
* Browsing or searching the Pandas [API Reference](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html) is an excellent way to locate a function even if you don't know its exact name.
* [What I do when I get a new data set as told through tweets](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/13/what-i-do-when-i-get-a-new-data-set-as-told-through-tweets/) is a fun (yet enlightening) look at the process of exploratory data analysis.

If you're using Anaconda, install Seaborn by running `conda install seaborn` at the command line. (Note that some students in past courses have had problems with Anaconda after installing Seaborn.)

**API Resources:**
* This Python script to [query the U.S. Census API](https://github.com/laurakurup/census-api) was created by a former DAT student. It's a bit more complicated than the example we used in class, it's very well commented, and it may provide a useful framework for writing your own code to query APIs.
* [Mashape](https://www.mashape.com/explore) and [Apigee](https://apigee.com/providers) allow you to explore tons of different APIs. Alternatively, a [Python API wrapper](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/api/list-of-python-apis) is available for many popular APIs.
* The [Data Science Toolkit](http://www.datasciencetoolkit.org/) is a collection of location-based and text-related APIs.
* [API Integration in Python](https://realpython.com/blog/python/api-integration-in-python/) provides a very readable introduction to REST APIs.
* Microsoft's [Face Detection API](https://www.projectoxford.ai/demo/face#detection), which powers [How-Old.net](http://how-old.net/), is a great example of how a machine learning API can be leveraged to produce a compelling web application.

**Web Scraping Resources:**
* The [Beautiful Soup documentation](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) is incredibly thorough, but is hard to use as a reference guide. However, the section on [specifying a parser](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#specifying-the-parser-to-use) may be helpful if Beautiful Soup appears to be parsing a page incorrectly.
* For more Beautiful Soup examples and tutorials, see [Web Scraping 101 with Python](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/03/03/web-scraping-101-with-python/), a former DAT student's well-commented notebook on [scraping Craigslist](https://github.com/Alexjmsherman/DataScience_GeneralAssembly/blob/master/Final_Project/1.%20Final_Project_Data%20Scraping.ipynb), this [notebook](http://web.stanford.edu/~zlotnick/TextAsData/Web_Scraping_with_Beautiful_Soup.html) from Stanford's Text As Data course, and this [notebook](https://github.com/cs109/2014/blob/master/lectures/2014_09_23-lecture/data_scraping_transcript.ipynb) and associated [video](http://cm.dce.harvard.edu/2015/01/14328/L07/screen_H264LargeTalkingHead-16x9.shtml) from Harvard's Data Science course.
* For a much longer web scraping tutorial covering Beautiful Soup, lxml, XPath, and Selenium, watch [Web Scraping with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1iX0uxM1w8) (3 hours 23 minutes) from PyCon 2014. The [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uHM_esB13VuSf7O1ScGueisnrtu-6usGFD3fs4z5YCE/edit#slide=id.p) and [code](https://github.com/kjam/python-web-scraping-tutorial) are also available.
* For more complex web scraping projects, [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) is a popular application framework that works with Python. It has excellent [documentation](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/1.0/index.html), and here's a [tutorial](https://github.com/rdempsey/ddl-data-wrangling) with detailed slides and code.
* [robotstxt.org](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html) has a concise explanation of how to write (and read) the `robots.txt` file.
* [import.io](https://import.io/) and [Kimono](https://www.kimonolabs.com/) claim to allow you to scrape websites without writing any code.
* [How a Math Genius Hacked OkCupid to Find True Love](http://www.wired.com/2014/01/how-to-hack-okcupid/all/) and [How Netflix Reverse Engineered Hollywood](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/?single_page=true) are two fun examples of how web scraping has been used to build interesting datasets.

* Watch [Kaggle: How it Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoD84TVdD-4) (4 minutes) for a brief overview of the Kaggle platform.

* Download the competition files, move them to the `DAT8/data` directory, and make sure you can open the CSV files using Pandas. If you have any problems opening the files, you probably need to turn off real-time virus scanning (especially Microsoft Security Essentials).

* **Optional:** Come up with some theories about which features might be relevant to predicting the response, and then explore the data to see if those theories appear to be true.
* **Optional:** Watch Kevin Markum's [project presentation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGr1yQV3Um0) (16 minutes) for a tour of the end-to-end machine learning process for a Kaggle competition, including feature engineering.

**NLP Resources:**
* If you want to learn a lot more NLP, check out the excellent [video lectures](https://class.coursera.org/nlp/lecture) and [slides](http://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/NLPCourseraSlides.html) from this [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/course/nlp) (which is no longer being offered).
* This slide deck defines many of the [key NLP terms](https://github.com/ga-students/DAT_SF_9/blob/master/16_Text_Mining/DAT9_lec16_Text_Mining.pdf).
* [Natural Language Processing with Python](http://www.nltk.org/book/) is the most popular book for going in-depth with the [Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org/) (NLTK).
* [A Smattering of NLP in Python](https://github.com/charlieg/A-Smattering-of-NLP-in-Python/blob/master/A%20Smattering%20of%20NLP%20in%20Python.ipynb) provides a nice overview of NLTK

<!-- , as does this [notebook from DAT5](https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT5/blob/master/notebooks/14_nlp.ipynb).  -->
* [spaCy](http://spacy.io/) is a newer Python library for text processing that is focused on performance (unlike NLTK).
* If you want to get serious about NLP, [Stanford CoreNLP](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml) is a suite of tools (written in Java) that is highly regarded.
* When working with a large text corpus in scikit-learn, [HashingVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#vectorizing-a-large-text-corpus-with-the-hashing-trick) is a useful alternative to CountVectorizer.
* [Automatically Categorizing Yelp Businesses](http://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2015/09/automatically-categorizing-yelp-businesses.html) discusses how Yelp uses NLP and scikit-learn to solve the problem of uncategorized businesses.
* [Modern Methods for Sentiment Analysis](http://districtdatalabs.silvrback.com/modern-methods-for-sentiment-analysis) shows how "word vectors" can be used for more accurate sentiment analysis.
* [Identifying Humorous Cartoon Captions](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~dshahaf/pHumor.pdf) is a readable paper about identifying funny captions submitted to the New Yorker Caption Contest.
